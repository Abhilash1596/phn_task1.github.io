	<p>As a guide, if you choose to dine early and leave your table by 07:00pm or later, or book a table from 07:30, there is a higher chance we are able to offer you a window table/ a specific area of the restaruant. However, we cannot always guarantee this availablity due to other bookings and table configurations.</p>
